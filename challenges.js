// Do either you or your partner have a pet? If so, you'll be describing them. Otherwise, have fun inventing an animal together.


// For each of the following questions, store the answer in a variable. 
// Then, fill in the blank in the comment with the data type you've used.
// Finally, console.log a message using that variable.

// === EXAMPLE ===
// 0. How many times does your pet eat each day?
const meals = 2;
// The data type is __number__.
console.log("My pet eats " + meals + " meals a day.");


// 1. What is the pet's name?
// The data type is ___.
// const ___ = ___


// 2. How old is the pet?
// The data type is ___.


// 3. What type of animal is the pet?
// The data type is ___.


// 4. Is the pet female?
// The data type is ___.


// 5. Approximately how much do you think the pet weighs?
// The data type is ___.




// You shouldn't need it often, but JavaScript has a neat built-in function called "typeof" which can tell you the data type stored in a variable.
// For example, if you call typeof("koala"), JavaScript will give you "string."


// Check your answers now with five call to console.log, which print statements of the form "Penelope is a string."

// console.log(___ + " is a " + typeof())
